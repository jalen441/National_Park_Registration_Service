## National_Park_Registration_Service

My second mini-capstone project from Tech Elevator. A CLI program for checking and reserving campsites via a (fake) national parks database.

Like the vending machine program, this uses C#, but reads and writes from an SQL database instead of a sequential access file.

Instructions/requirements are found in a .pdf file, located in the \etc directory.

The db script is also in the \etc directory.
